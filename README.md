Rewriting it to make it more streamlined due to the design patterns I've learned recently.

Goal 1: Make an ugly MVP (in progress)
    - allow deck preview that updates without reloading the page
    - allow user to add cards
    - allow user to study a card by pushing its due date into the future some arbitrary amount (nothing special, just say, 10 mins for now, you can add studying algorithms later)
GOAL 2: Allow studying to work properly (Not yet started)
GOAL 3: Add nice-to-have features (Not yet started)
    - local storage so cards persist across sessions
GOAL 4: Add options for more nice-to-have features (Not yet started)
